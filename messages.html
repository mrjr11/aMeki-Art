  <!--Scenario: You have a child. By law you're required to enroll your child in school for 12 years or you can be jailed up to 60 days
    and fined. You can also homeschool them. The reality is the average household does not have the time or resources to homeschool and 
    so they're forced to subject they're children to training and learning that is not geared to success but rather a life of subservience.-->
